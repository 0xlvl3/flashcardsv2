Design:
	-----
	Following from my CLI Flashcards application I want to create,
	the same application but now with a GUI. Flashcards V2 will
	have a GUI with a authentication and database for the cards.
	You will be able to create an account, that will have it's own
	database to save Decks and flashcards. You will be able to create
	a deck, delete a deck, list flashcards from the deck, add flashcards,
	play through a deck and maybe more.

GUI:
	-----
	Kivy


Backend:
	-----
	Firebase, will also do authentication through firebase

		Methods:
			create()
			delete()

			list()
	
	Flashcards:
		Vars:

		Methods:
			add_flashcard()
